# Alura Plus Landing Page

The **Alura Plus  Landing Page** is a simple project developed with HTML and CSS, showcasing a static sales page for online courses. The design is non-responsive and focused solely on front-end development as part of my learning experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the page.
- **CSS3**: Styling and layout.

## Features

- Display of Alura courses with information and images.
- Static layout, no interactions or back-end functionality.
- Non-responsive design.
